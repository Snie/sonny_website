## How Claude Skills Are Structured

`.claude/skills` are created with the best practices obtained from the
[official documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#create-your-first-skill).

Every `SKILL.md` must open with YAML frontmatter between `---` markers. Required fields:

```yaml
---
name: example-best-practices   # Slug for the /slash-command. Lowercase, hyphens, max 64.
description: One-line plain string. What it does and when to use it. Front-load the key case.
metadata:
  update-policy: monthly        # monthly | quarterly | manual | never
  update-source: https://example.org  # URL to fetch directly, or "web-search"
  last-updated: "2026-03-29"    # Date content was last refreshed: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

The `metadata` key is used for project-specific fields. Do not place `update-policy`,
`update-source`, or `last-updated` at the top level — they are not part of the Claude Code
standard and will trigger validation warnings if placed outside `metadata`.

## Rules

README.md is for humans: quick start, project description, contribution guidelines. AGENTS.md
complements it with detailed context for coding agents and humans who want depth: conventions,
rules, and instructions that would clutter a README or are irrelevant to casual contributors.
Do not duplicate content between the two. If something belongs in README.md, it stays there.
If it belongs in AGENTS.md, it stays there.

- Whenever writing markdown, lint it using `markdownlint-cli2`.
- Whenever creating GitHub Actions, pin to a commit hash instead of a version tag.

## Core Concepts

**Role split:**

- Human = spec owner + evaluator (defines WHAT and WHY, never HOW)
- Powerful and expensive LLM = lead orchestrator (architecture decisions, spec review)
- Less powerful, and cheaper LLM = subagent worker

**Spec driven development:**

TODO

**Clean markdowns:**

- Plain english only
- max line length is 120
- linted markdown with respect to .markdownlint.jsonc, the same file used by the linter
- the linter is installed and available

## Lint Markdown

after writing each markdown file, run markdownlint-cli2 and fix any violations before moving to the next file:

```bash
markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"
```
